You will have 60 seconds. Here's an example: </p> <div><img src='assets/buildDemo.gif' id='example_screen'></div> <p>To build a tower, select a block from the menu by clicking on it. Click again to place it in the window above.</p><p> There are only a certain number of viable locations, corresponding to the grid in the background. You'll see a slightly transparent block that 'snaps' to these locations, indicating where the block will appear when you click. However, you can't place a block anywhere- once placed, blocks will be subject to gravity.</p><p>This means they can fall! If this happens, your turn will end and you'll have to wait until the next trial to continue. Here's an example:</p><div><img src='assets/failDemo.gif' id='example_screen'></div> <p> Be careful when you place blocks, as there is no way to move a block after it is placed- nor is there any way to reset your tower and start again. </p><p>Your job is to try and create the most accurate tower you can on <b>every trial</b>.</p>",

In each trial you will either build a new tower, or one you've built before.</p><p>For really accurate towers, you will receive a <b> bonus</b> between $0.01 and $0.05.</p><p>You can also earn a time bonus of up to 1Â¢ by finishing your tower quickly, but you'll only earn this if your tower is <b>also accurate.</b></p>",

No bonus can be earned on this practice trial. Please place the blocks precisely over these guides to ensure that you have the opportunity to proceed and participate in the experiment.</p><p>Please note that after you place a block, you will not be able to select a new block or press 'Done' until all of the blocks have come to rest. </p>",
