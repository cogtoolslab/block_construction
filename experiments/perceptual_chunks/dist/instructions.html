          <p>Welome to our HIT! We are scientists at the University of California San Diego, studying how people see complex shapes.</p>
          <p>In this study you will be shown a series of different shapes, and asked to color them in according to how you see different parts of the shape.</p>
          <p>For example, look at this shape:</p>
          <p>To many people, this shape looks like it could be made from two squares, like this:</p>
          <p>In this study, we'll be asking you to color in shapes like this, with different colors for the different parts you identify. As the shapes you'll be working with are a bit more complex, there won't be a single correct way of coloring them in. However, you should try to color them in a way that is obvious to you- so that if you saw the shape again you would probably find the same shapes next time.</p>
          <p>As long as different parts are designated by different colors, the specific colors you choose do not matter. These two are equivalent:</p>
          <p>But make sure you have selected different colors each time: the two </p>
