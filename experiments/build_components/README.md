# build_components

This experiment explores the components of building activity that affect memory.

## Decisions
- Trial randomization
  - Done in js
  - Learning phase
    - Random shuffle, rejecting sequences with >3 of same condition in a row
  - Recall phase
    - Random shuffle, rejecting sequences with >3 of same condition in a row
- 

# pilot
- initially tried psuedorandom assignments to conditions (8 build, 8 view, 8 foil)

# pilot_2
- true random assignment to conditions (6 build, 6 view, 12 foil)
- Ran x ppts


# Building Retrieval side of study

- New config experimentConfigBuildRetrieval
- New iteration names: build_components_build_retrieval_*
- New plugin (for free recall building)
- Do not change other plug ins!
