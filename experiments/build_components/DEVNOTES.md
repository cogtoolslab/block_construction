# Development Notes

Use this to keep track of design decisions


### Design thoughts

- Sequential presentation
  - Presenting the composite of learned chunks could prime people to see wide vs. tall decomposition
  - None of the studies in Guan & Firestone involve showing a target and the potential pieces in a single trial.
   - I think that this is going to be too much information for people to take in at once, especially at the timescales that they're talking about.

- Show both at same time, but flash composite up just before.


### Plugins


#### Building
- participant should build it perfectly in a sequence of actions
  - auto-advance when structure is built correctly, otherwise, reset when 4 blocks placed?
- 



#### Zipping

- Can use jspsych-image-keyboard-response just to display a stim (choices: jsPsych.NO_KEYS)
  - If we go with sequential presentation of composite and parts this would be good!



## todo before running final version 

- mask?
- rename rep to miniblock
