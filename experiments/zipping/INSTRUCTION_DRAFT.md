In this study you will be shown various shapes and asked to make judgements about their parts.

The study consists of many "trials". In each trial, you will be shown a large shape, like this one:

It will then disappear, and you will be shown two smaller shapes, like these:

Your task is to say whether or not the large shape can be made from the two smaller ones. For example, this *is* the case for the shapes you've just seen- if the small shapes were "pushed" together so that they were touching, they would make the large shape above. You would respond '*yes*' in this case, by pressing "M". On the other hand, the two shapes below would not make up the larger shape when moved together:

You would respond '*no*' in this case, by pressing "Z". 

Sometimes the two smaller shapes will appear side by side, as they do in the examples above. In other trials, you'll see two shapes on top of one another, like this:

The task is the same- you have to decide whether the small shapes can make up the larger one- but in these trials you'd have to imagine whether they could be pushed together vertically to make the big shape. Here are some more examples:

Please try to respond as quickly and accurately as possible. After your response you will see the large shape again, with a green border if your response was correct or a red border if it was incorrect. There will be 3 blocks of 48 trials, and you will have a chance to take a break between each of these blocks.
