    "zippingInstructions": '<p>In this part of the study you will be shown various shapes and asked to make judgements about their parts.</p><p>In each trial, you will first be shown a <strong>large shape</strong>, like this one:</p><img src="../img/instruction_images/1_whole.png" style="max-width: 200px"><p>This shape will quickly <strong>disappear behind a black and white grid</strong>, and you then will be shown <strong>two smaller shapes</strong>, that might look something like this:</p><img src="../img/instruction_images/1_valid_tall.png" style="max-width: 200px"><p><strong>Your task is to say whether or not the large shape could be made by placing the two smaller shapes next to each other.</strong> For example, this <i>is</i> the case for the shapes you\'ve just seen- if the small shapes were "pushed" together so that they were touching, they would make the large shape above. You would respond <strong>yes ✅</strong> in this case, by pressing "YES_KEY". On the other hand, the two shapes below would <i>not</i> make up the larger shape when moved together:</p><img src="../img/instruction_images/1_invalid_tall.png" style="max-width: 200px"></br><p>You would respond <strong>no ❌</strong> in this case, by pressing "NO_KEY".</p><p>Sometimes the two smaller shapes will appear side by side, as they do in the examples above. In other trials, you\'ll see two shapes on top of one another, like this:</p><img src="../img/instruction_images/1_valid_wide.png" style="max-width: 200px"></br><p>The task is the same- you have to decide whether the small shapes can make up the larger one- but in these trials you would have to imagine whether they could be pushed together vertically to make the big shape. The small shapes will always appear the right way up, which means you won\'t need to rotate them in your head to answer yes or no. But make sure you look at <strong>both</strong> shapes carefully, as both need to be right for you to answer yes. Here are some more examples:</p><img src="../img/instruction_images/example_responses.png" style="max-width: 500px"></br><p>Between trials, you will see be a center cross (+) on the screen so that you know where to look. When the small shapes appear the cross will turn blue (<span class="blue-text">+</span>), letting you know that you can respond. <i>Please try to press the correct key as quickly as possible</i>. Once you\'ve pressed a key, you\'ll be told whether your response was right or wrong. There will be 2 blocks of 36 trials, and you will have a chance to take a quick break between each of these blocks. Press next to load the task and continue.</p>',
