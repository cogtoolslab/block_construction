In <strong>Part 1</strong>, you will see  a series of shapes, and will asked build block towers that match each shape.</p><p>The shape will appear in the window on the left. In the right window, you can click on a block to pick it up. A transparent block will appear to show you where your block will fall, and you can click again to place it in that location.</p><img src="../img/zip_demo_building.png" style="max-width: 100%"><p>Your goal is to build a single tower of exactly the same shape as is shown on the left, somewhere in the right window. Blocks cannot be moved once placed, but you can remove all of the blocks and restart by pressing the reset button. You have as long as you need to build the tower, but you will only move on to the next trial when you have perfectly copied the shape, so the faster you build it correctly the sooner you will be done with the experiment.</p>',
    "zippingInstructions": '<p><strong>Part 2</strong> of the experiment does not involve any building. Instead, you will be shown different shapes, and asked to make judgements about their parts.</p><p>In each trial, you wil first see a <strong>big shape</strong>, like this one:</p><img src="../img/zip_demo_composite.png" style="max-width: 100%"><p>The big shape will quickly disappear, and you will then see <strong>two smaller shapes</strong>, like these:</p><img src="../img/zip_demo_parts_tall.png" style="max-width: 100%"><p><strong>Your task is to say whether or not the big shape could be made by combining these two small shapes.</strong> This <strong>is</strong> the case for the shapes you\'ve just seen- you could push them together to make the big shape.</p><p>In some trials the small shapes will appear side-by-side, as above. In other trials, you will two small shapes on top of each other. Here you are still saying whether or not you could combine the small shapes to make the big one. For example, these shapes could pushed together to make the big one:</p><img src="../img/zip_demo_parts_wide.png" style="max-width: 100%"></br><p>To respond, if you think the small shapes can be combined to make the big shape, you should press "M". Alternatively, if you do not think the small shapes can be combined to make the big shape, you should press "Z". We will remind you what buttons to press when you reach Part 2. Here are some examples: </p><img src="../img/zip_demo_responses.png" style="max-width: 100%"><p>After your response you will see the big shape again, with a green border if you pressed the correct button, or a red border if you pressed the wrong button. Please try to respond as quickly and accurately as possible!</p>'
