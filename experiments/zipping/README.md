#### pre-pilot
- Ran ~10 ppts
- 3 different stim durations [100,500,1000]
- Stimuli were not counterbalanced
- 


#### pilot
- 3 different stim durations: 32, 64, 128 ms
  - Run 3 reps of a single stim duration by setting e.g. stimDurations = [32, 32, 32]
    - These durations have now been moved to metadata!
- 3 original stimuli are counterbalanced (each gets a turn at being novel)
