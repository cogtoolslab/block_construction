Pilot Experiment.

Using matter.js

Notes:
Have updated 'sleeping' constants that are hardcoded in the matter.js file
These need to be changed whenever gravity is changed.
Gravity needs to be changed whenever scale factor (the size of the blocks) is changed.

First block body number is 5 (after the ground, two targets, and some other things?)
